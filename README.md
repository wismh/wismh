Programming is my passion because it allows me to craft expansive and extraordinary systems ⚙️. <br/>
When combined with mathematics 📏, it truly feels like conjuring magic 🌈. <br/>
Imagine what unfolds when we integrate physics 🧲 and biology 🔬. The only limit is one's imagination 🌌. <br/>
<br/>
So, I just want to continue to have the opportunity to create, and develop in this area, <br/>
so that I can create more and more amazing things ✏️
